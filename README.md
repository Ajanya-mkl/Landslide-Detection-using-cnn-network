# Landslide-Detection-using-cnn-network

Project Description:
The Landslide Detection project focuses on the development of a Deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for the detection of landslides in satellite images. Landslides are natural disasters that can cause significant damage, and early detection is crucial for mitigation and response. This project aims to automate the process of identifying potential landslide areas from satellite images.

Data Collection:
The project starts by collecting a dataset of satellite images. These images serve as input data for the model.
training, validation, and test data, for both the satellite images (X) and their corresponding labels (Y).

Data Visualization:
The project visualizes a sample of the data to provide a better understanding of the dataset. It shows examples of satellite images and their corresponding labels (ground truth).

CNN Model Architecture:
The core of this project is the CNN model architecture designed for image classification tasks.
The model architecture follows a U-Net-like structure, which is commonly used for image segmentation tasks.
It includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers for regularization, and up-sampling layers.
The final layer uses sigmoid activation to predict whether each pixel in the image represents a landslide or not.

Training the Model:
The model is trained using the training data (X_train and Y_train) and validated using the validation data (X_val and Y_val).
Training involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize a binary cross-entropy loss function.
The training process is carried out over multiple epochs (in this case, 10 epochs), and the training progress is monitored.

Model Evaluation:
The trained model's performance is evaluated using the test data (X_test and Y_test).
The project reports the test loss and accuracy, which indicate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

Making Predictions:
The model is used to make predictions on test data. Predictions are generated for each image in the test set.

Visualization of Results:
The project provides a visual demonstration of the model's performance by showing satellite images along with ground truth labels and model predictions.
Key Outputs:
A trained CNN model for landslide detection.
Evaluation metrics (test loss and accuracy) indicating the model's performance.
Visualizations showing model predictions on test data.
